# Life-UnderWear
IoT project focused on wearable technology for people with disabilities built with Arduino as main software development.


This project works as a set of sensors which together make the whole system of care for people who cannot notify whenever they need to be attended.

It was created together with a ready made underwear and a set of special conductive materials and boards to make it work a smart underwear



In the following archives you can find each electornic component needed and described for the project. 

1. _Lilypad Arduino Board_ : This board was the one used for this project due to its special characteristics for wearable technologies.


2 _Pulsometer_ : This is a sensor which can detect the heart pulse from the vital signal of our body and plot it as a function of beats                     per minute (BPM) with respect to time. 


3. _Liquid Sensor_ : This is a sensor which was specially programmed to output the categorical value of whether if the sensor (which would                        be place inside of the underwear) detectes any kind of humidity produced by the person using it. 


4. _Temperature Sensor_ : This is a sensor which can show you the current temperature as a continuous data in Celsius or Fahrenheit                                   degrees. 




I hope you liked this kind of projects that are aimed at improving people with disabilities' lives, and take it as a model or guide in any of your projects. 


Thank you so much.
